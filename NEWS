For version 4.0 Tina's Random Number Generators Library was rewritten
from scratch and got a new interface. This interface was inspired by
"Random Number Generation in C++0X: A Comprehensive Proposal" by
Walter E. Brown, Mark Fischler, Jim Kowalkowski and Marc Paterno.
This proposal describes an extensible pseudorandom number generator
facility, which will be (up to minor changes) part of the forthcoming
revision of the ISO C++ standard.

See the «History» section in trng.pdf in the doc directory for a 
detailed changelog on TRNG versions.
